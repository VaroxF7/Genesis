				"So, the &2Modpack&r is focused on making the &2GregTech Experience better for everyone&r, while also being better for everyone else. We have &6Create&r, &6Tinker's&r and so many more mods just to name a few. We want to make the &2Recipes easier&r, &2less grindy&r but at the same time add &6more content&r, which is a hard task."

				"So we came up with this idea, &2early game content before AE2&r, is a lot easier to progress or changed in progression in general. So &2LV and MV&r is a bit easier or changed up in some spots. As you get to &6AE2&r and autocrafting the recipes and progression gets abit harder, but since you get autocrafting, its not as bad for you right?"
